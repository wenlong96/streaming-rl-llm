ALL PROJECTS:

## PROJECT: WiLLi — Real-Time RLHF AI Clone Chatbot

WiLLi is Will's personal AI clone, built as a portfolio project to demonstrate end-to-end ML engineering, LLM fine-tuning, and real-time data streaming capabilities.

**Architecture Overview:**

* **Frontend:** Streamlit app with dual-mode operation — Public chat mode and Admin RLHF training mode (password-protected).
* **Backend:** FastAPI serving on Port 8000, with async streaming responses using TextIteratorStreamer and Python threading for non-blocking generation.
* **LLM Setup:** Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct model, quantized to 4-bit NF4 using BitsAndBytes with double quantization, reducing VRAM usage from ~6GB to ~2GB. LoRA adapter (r=16, alpha=32) applied on q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj attention layers.
* **RAG Pipeline:** Resume PDF ingested using PyPDFLoader, chunked and embedded with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional dense vectors), stored in ChromaDB. Top-k=4 cosine similarity retrieval at inference time.
* **RLHF Training Loop:** Admin can submit DPO training pairs via the UI. Pairs are produced to a Redpanda (Kafka-compatible) topic called `rlhf-feedback` using `confluent-kafka`. A separate training process consumes from the topic and runs real-time DPO gradient steps using TRL's DPOTrainer with beta=0.1 KL penalty. LoRA adapter is dynamically saved and reloaded by the API.

## PROJECT: Graphical Models for Ad Campaign Optimization

Collaborated with a Singapore-based digital marketing company to optimize Meta advertising campaigns for real estate developers, minimizing Cost-Per-Lead (CPL) through advanced Bayesian inference.

**Key Techniques & Architecture:**

* **DAG / Bayesian Network:** Modeled probabilistic causal relationships between media buy inputs (budget, platform, audiences), latent demographics, headline elements (NLP embeddings), intermediate metrics (CPM, CTR, Reach), and CPL outputs.
* **EM-MAP Estimation:** Used Expectation-Maximization with Maximum-A-Posteriori imputation to infer latent demographic variables (Age, Gender) from observable campaign data. Marginal priors were derived from SensorTower. Convergence achieved within 10-20 iterations.
* **HMM for Seasonality:** Modeled irregular monthly impression spikes (Lunar New Year, year-end sales) using a latent-state Hidden Markov Model. Utilized a Negative Binomial emission distribution to handle high variance-to-mean ratios. Implemented via **Pyro** using `DiscreteHMM` and optimized with Adam.
* **Graph Embeddings:** Leveraged SentenceTransformers (`Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`) to generate and integrate headline embeddings into the causal graph.

## PROJECT: Graph Machine Learning (GNNs & Graph Transformers)

Framed ad campaign optimization as a node-level prediction and segmentation problem on a k-NN campaign graph, where nodes represent campaign configurations.

* **Graph Transformer architecture:** Experimented with Global Attention mechanisms and Graph Transformers using Laplacian Positional Encoding (LapPE) to capture structural graph properties.
* **Insights:** Conducted deep evaluations on model expressivity, handling over-smoothing and over-expressivity trade-offs in fully connected attention models versus localized GNNs (using NetworkX and DGL).

## PROJECT: Risk, Fraud, and Anomaly Detection

Engineered an end-to-end Python pipeline for credit card fraud detection on highly imbalanced financial transaction data.

* **Data Engineering:** Interactive EDA and time-density tracking using `plotly.graph_objs` and `plotly.figure_factory`. Handled extreme class imbalances using **ADASYN** (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).
* **Modeling Ensemble:** Trained and evaluated an extensive suite of models including LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and SVMs.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized Bayesian Optimization via `skopt.BayesSearchCV` with `DeadlineStopper` and `DeltaYStopper` callbacks for highly efficient, automated hyperparameter search spaces.

## PROJECT: Nutri-Grade Food Classification System

Developed a computer vision system evaluating 78 Singaporean food categories (~39,000 images from FoodLG) to assign official "Nutri-Grade" health labels (A to D).

* **Architectures Evaluated:** Vanilla CNN, LeNet-5, VGG-16, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, Vision Transformer (ViT).
* **Key Findings:** EfficientNet-B0 achieved the best accuracy (82.78% Direct 4-Class) due to balanced compound scaling. The ViT model initially suffered from severe dataset-size overfitting (35% accuracy), which was successfully mitigated to 64% by freezing the backbone and reducing model complexity. Hierarchical prediction pipelines (78-class to 4-class mapping) boosted deeper models like VGG-16.

## PROJECT: High-Performance Time Series Forecasting (R & Deep Learning)

Built scalable forecasting architectures for daily sales and inventory demand modeling, yielding a 20% MAPE reduction in enterprise use-cases.

* **LSTM Networks:** Developed Deep Learning sequences using Keras/TensorFlow in R. Handled day-of-week and previous-day autocorrelation effects via rigorous PACF analysis.
* **LightGBM & Parallelization:** Engineered rolling-window time series features (1d/7d lags) using `dplyr` and `lubridate`. Extracted multiplicative seasonalities using `imputeTS`.
* **Compute Optimization:** Sped up computation bottlenecks by implementing multicore parallelization using the `doParallel` and `foreach` packages, generating isolated time-series models for 50+ item categories concurrently.

## PROJECT: Relational Database Architecture (Q&M Dental)

Designed and implemented a comprehensive scheduling and inventory database for Singapore's largest private dental group.

* **Data Modeling:** Translated complex business requirements into a structured Entity Relationship Model (ERM), resolving specific cardinalities for personnel (dentists, receptionists), specialized services, and clinical inventory.
* **Logical Design:** Normalized schema up to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate transitive and partial dependencies.
* **Implementation:** Deployed robust MySQL schemas enforcing tight referential integrity via cascading foreign keys, enabling real-time multi-branch room and equipment scheduling.
